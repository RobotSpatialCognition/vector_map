# vector_map: creates vector maps from occupancy maps generated by SLAM.

## (beta)
# vector_map
Vector maps consist of geometric elements such as straight lines and curves, and are extremely suitable for robot action planning using algebraic geometry methods and AI methods. This is created by removing noise from the occupancy map information generated by SLAM, extracting line segment elements consisting of single straight lines and curves, and accurately identifying the position of the corners between line segment elements. The vector_map library performs these processes, and also has functions that make it easier to handle topological structures by representing the created vector map as a set of hierarchical objects.
